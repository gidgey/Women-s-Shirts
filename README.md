# Women's Shirts

Women's Shirts for WordCamps / Sponsors

I have a passion for marketing, WordPress, and WordCamps. 

Maybe we should share this kind of information.

My email is gidgey@gmail.com.

### Unisex Is a Man's Shirt

I know this is controversial, but the sleeve length, length of the torso, the straight cut, and the neckline of a unisex shirt is not only built for a man's body but can be unflattering to a woman.

### Can We Do Better?

We are WordPress. Of course we can do better. 

We do better by sharing information. We do better by collaborating. We do better by listening to all the voices.

### Can This Be Solved on GitHub?

I have no idea. But WordPress organizers and developers are used to communicating this way. I thought it was worth a try. If it becomes popular, maybe it can be a blog post (p2) on the Make.WordPress.org/Community. For now, I thought it would be a good idea to put this out there.
